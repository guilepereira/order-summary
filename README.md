## My process

In this project I tried to improve my coding process based on the perceptions and feedbacks I had in previous projects, so my focus was to refine my accuracy in achieving the proposed design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox;
- Accessibility;
- Methodology BEM (Block Element Modifier);
- Atomic Design.

### What I learned

In this project, I started to improve my perception of relative measures, which I intend to improve in my next project, by applying the proportion of 62.5% to the font size. As for the BEM methodology, I could understand the use of "mixes" which solved some conflicts I had in previous projects.
